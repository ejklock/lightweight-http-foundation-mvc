# Lightweight MVC using Symfony Http Foundation

This is a very simple implementation of a MVC (Model-View-Controller)
using Symfony Http Foundation. It only implements the HTTP Kernel and the
Router. The Controller and the Model are not implemented at all.

The code is based on the Symfony Http Foundation components and is a good
starting point for a simple web application.

## Requirements

* PHP 7.2 or higher

## Installation

## Usage

To start the application run:

    docker-compose up

Then install the dependencies with:

    docker-compose exec app composer install
